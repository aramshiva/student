# Security Policy
The student takes security and user privacy very seriously. No user data is seen, read or stored by Student, and is only used to connect your device to Synergy's servers. The app is not used for malicious use, and is only used to make the user's experience better. Student takes privacy very seriously, and if you think you found a vulnerability or other issues, please email [security@aram.sh](mailto:security@aram.sh). I am a high school student, if your vulnerability is extremely severe, and is well documented and includes git patches (no AI slop please), a small compensation **may** be provided (no promises).
