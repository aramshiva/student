# PRIVACY

### Effective December 20th, 2025

Student was created by a privacy-minded teenager who wants a better alternative to StudentVUE®. We promise to never sell, share or see your student information.

## Who we are

Student (“we,” “us,” “our”) is a third-party alternative client for StudentVUE®. We are not affiliated with Edupoint Educational Systems, LLC, StudentVUE® (a product of Edupoint), or any school district.

We operate in the state of Washington, in the United States. StudentVUE® is a trademark of Edupoint Educational Systems, LLC.

## What information we collect about you.

We will never store the user's StudentVUE® data or log in information on our servers. We do not operate any user accounts.

**Credentials and student records** including any data returned by StudentVUE® (grades, test history, schedule, attendance) are **not stored** by us.

The user's data may be saved in browser storage (**local storage or cookies**) to keep the user signed in, remember the user's preferences and caching. This data is not stored by us.

Our hosting provider (Vercel, their privacy policy can be read [here](https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy)) may process **standard technical data** (anonymized IP address, user agent, timestamps, request metadata) in connection with delivering the Service, performance monitoring, and security. Again, no student records or credentials are included in this.

We use [**Umami Analytics**](https://umami.is/) (Their privacy policy can be read [here](https://umami.is/privacy)) to understand anonymized and aggregated usage of the service. Vercel Speed Analytics is also used to understand user experience statistics. These tools may collect device and user information such as pages viewed, approximate location (derived from IP), and device/browser characteristics. We do not use analytics to access your StudentVUE® credentials or student records.

## How we interact with StudentVUE®

When the user enters district information and sign in information, the Service sends the user's credentials to the user's school district's Synergy (a product of Edupoint, and the server powering StudentVUE®) server. **The user's credentials are used only for this purpose**. Data flows from the User to the Service to the Synergy server and back to the user to display the user's information.

## What we do not do

- We **do not** sell or share the user's information
- We **do not** collect student credentials or records in our own database.

## What Subprocessers touch your data

Student may share limited information to select subprocessers to deliver the Service and improve the service.

- With the user's district's Edupoint server (operating as StudentVUE®) when the user use the service to provide student records to display to the user.
- With infrastructure providers (Vercel) to host and deliver the service.
- With analytics providers (Umami Analytics; Vercel Speed Insights) for usage and performance improvement to help improve user experience.
- For legal reasons if required to comply with law or valid legal process.

## How we store your data

Our server and database do not store the user's data. The service may use browser storage and cookies to improve the user's experience, this is only visible to the user, not us. The user can clear stored data at any time by clearing site data for the service in the browser settings.

## How long we retain your data

StudentVUE® data is not stored on our servers. Analytics and operational logs are retained **anonymized** for the operational lifetime of the service to improve the user's experience

## Exercising your rights

As we do not collect user data, we cannot delete data we do not collect. Local laws may require different requirements (for example GDPR or CCPA), so requests (like deletion of email inquiries) can be sent to inquiries@aram.sh, and we will try doing our best.

## How we protect your data

We use Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) and take reasonable measures to protect the service. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure.

## Children's privacy

Student is intended for use by students, including those under 18, who have access to StudentVUE® through their school or district. We do not knowingly collect or store StudentVUE® credentials or student records on our server. If a parent/guardian believes we have received personal information directly (for example, through an email inquiry), please contact us at inquiries@aram.sh and we will delete it.

We act as a third party tool authorized at student/family discretion, and don't maintain educational records. Children under 13 should opt-out analytics in the settings page and receive parental consent to use the service.

## Changes to this policy

This policy may be changed at any time. We will post a new updated version with a new effective date.
